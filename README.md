# Java standart functional interfaces
This programm gives example of the use of lambdas and functional interfaces:

- Predicate<T>
defines an abstract method named test that accepts an object of generic type T and returns a boolean, used for filtering

- Consumer<T>
defines an abstract method named accept that takes an object of generic type T and returns no result (void), used for performing operations on elements

- Function<T, R>
defines an abstract method named apply that takes an object of generic type T as input and returns an object of generic type R, used for mapping
